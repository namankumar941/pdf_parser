### Energy Formula
Einstein's famous equation that expresses the relationship between energy (E), mass (m), and the speed of light (c). It states that the energy of a body is equal to its mass multiplied by the square of the speed of light.
\[E = mc^2\]

- Mathematical formulas: If formulas are present, convert and render them carefully in the HTML page using MathJax or similar.
- add Mathematical formulas using following "\(\)" notation in html page as used in example.
- Keep the HTML code concise and clean, using minimal but effective Tailwind classes.
- inside the <example></example> tag, provide the example for rendering Mathematical formulas in html file.
- add script inside head carefully so that formula is rendered perfectly.
- Add the <head>, <script>, and main content sections in their appropriate places within the HTML framework.
